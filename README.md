# PlaylistProject
This project is aimed to replicate a playlist system such as the one on Spotify.

You are allowed to have multiple playlists as well as multiple songs per playlist.

This is unfinished as of 8/12/2023.

Currently, this is on hiatus because I am on vacation. I wanted to code, but I had a more recent version of this project on my computer (which I do not have with me).
